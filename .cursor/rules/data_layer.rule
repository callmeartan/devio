// This rule applies to models and repositories
// pattern: **/models/*.dart, **/repositories/*.dart, **/services/*.dart

**Models/Database**
- Include `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `isDeleted` in Firestore docs.
- Use `@JsonSerializable(fieldRename: FieldRename.snake)` for models.
- Use `@JsonKey(includeFromJson: true, includeToJson: false)` for read-only fields.
- Implement proper timestamp conversion for Firestore dates.
- Use factory constructors for creating model instances.
- Document field constraints and validation rules.
- Keep model classes focused on a single responsibility.
- Use `@JsonValue(int)` for enums stored in DB.
- Utilize streams for reactive programming when appropriate.

**Dart/Flutter**
- Leverage Freezed for immutable state classes and unions.
- Use arrow syntax for simple functions/methods.
- Prefer expression bodies for one-liner getters/setters.
- Use trailing commas for better formatting and diffs.
