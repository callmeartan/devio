**Widgets**
- Use `const` constructors for immutable widgets.
- Create small, private widget classes instead of `_build` methods.
- Use `RefreshIndicator` for pull-to-refresh.
- Set `textCapitalization`, `keyboardType`, and `textInputAction` in `TextField`.
- Always include `errorBuilder` in `Image.network`.
- Extract complex widget logic to separate methods.
- Prefer stateless widgets when possible.
- Use keys appropriately for widget identity.
- Use `const` widgets to optimize rebuilds.
- Optimize lists with `ListView.builder`.
- Use `AssetImage` for static images, `cached_network_image` for remote.

**UI/Styling**
- Use Flutter's built-in widgets; create custom widgets as needed.
- Implement responsive design with `LayoutBuilder` or `MediaQuery`.
- Use `Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge` instead of deprecated styles.
- Extract reusable UI components into separate widget classes.
- Use Material Design 3 components for modern UI.
- Ensure accessibility with semantic labels and sufficient contrast.
