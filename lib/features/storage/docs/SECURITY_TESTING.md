# Security Testing Plan for Local Mode

This document outlines the security testing plan for the Local Mode feature.

## Security Objectives

1. **Data Protection:** Ensure local data is protected from unauthorized access
2. **Privacy Preservation:** Verify no data leakage to cloud services
3. **Secure Storage:** Confirm sensitive data is stored securely
4. **Authentication Security:** Validate local authentication mechanisms
5. **Export Security:** Ensure exported data is handled securely

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Local Data Storage Security

**Test Actions:**
- Examine how data is stored in the local SQLite database
- Verify iOS data protection is enabled for app files
- Check file permissions on database and preference files

**Expected Behavior:**
- Database files should be stored in protected app sandbox
- Files should have appropriate permissions
- iOS data protection should be enabled

### 2. Sensitive Information Handling

**Test Actions:**
- Identify all sensitive information stored locally
- Check how user credentials are stored
- Verify secure storage usage for sensitive data

**Expected Behavior:**
- Sensitive information should use `flutter_secure_storage`
- No plaintext storage of credentials
- Proper key management for any encrypted data

### 3. Local Authentication Security

**Test Actions:**
- Test local authentication mechanisms
- Attempt to bypass authentication
- Check session persistence behavior

**Expected Behavior:**
- Authentication should use secure methods
- Session tokens should be stored securely
- Proper timeout and invalidation of sessions

### 4. Export Data Security

**Test Actions:**
- Export chat data and examine the exported files
- Check if exported files contain sensitive information
- Verify how exported files are handled

**Expected Behavior:**
- Exported files should be created securely
- User should be warned about security implications of exports
- Temporary files should be cleaned up after export

### 5. Application Binary Security

**Test Actions:**
- Check app binary for hardcoded secrets
- Verify app transport security settings
- Test for jailbreak/root detection if implemented

**Expected Behavior:**
- No hardcoded secrets in the binary
- Proper app transport security settings
- Appropriate detection of compromised environments

## Security Testing Methods

### Static Analysis

- Code review focusing on:
  - Data storage implementation
  - Authentication mechanisms
  - Export functionality
  - Error handling and logging

### Dynamic Analysis

- Runtime testing:
  - Monitor file system access
  - Track network communications
  - Observe memory for sensitive data

### Tools

- **Database Inspection:** SQLite browser tools
- **Network Monitoring:** Charles Proxy, Wireshark
- **Binary Analysis:** MobSF, Frida
- **File System Analysis:** iExplorer (iOS), ADB (Android)

## Security Reporting

When reporting security issues, please include:

1. Issue description and severity assessment
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested mitigation
5. Supporting evidence (logs, screenshots)

## Security Considerations for Users

Document the following for users:

1. Data recovery limitations in Local Mode
2. Security implications of exporting data
3. Device security recommendations (use passcode/biometrics)
4. What happens if the app is deleted
