## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Which platforms does Devio support?**  
A: Devio is currently available for iOS. Android and desktop versions are planned for future releases.

**Q: Is an internet connection required?**

A: Navigate to Settings > AI Providers > Local LLM, then enter the API endpoint URL of your running local LLM server.

**Q: What are the minimum system requirements for local LLM integration?**  
A: Your device should be on the same network as the machine running the LLM. The specific hardware requirements depend on the LLM you're running locally.

A: Basic functionality is available without an account. Creating an account allows you to sync settings across devices and access premium features.
