## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical App Store Requirements
Focus on tasks in sections 1-3 to address immediate App Store concerns:
1. Replace error messages with setup guidance
2. Improve first-time user experience
3. Make connection setup intuitive and guided

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
Implement tasks in sections 4-5 to improve overall quality:
1. Improve settings and server monitoring
2. Add fallback functionality for disconnected state

### Phase 3: Polish and Extended Features
Complete remaining tasks for a fully polished experience:

2. Expand help resources
3. Implement advanced monitoring features

## Testing Priorities

1. **Disconnected State Testing**
   - Verify no error messages appear in UI
   - Confirm guidance is clear and helpful
   - Test that setup flow works as expected

2. **Connection Flow Testing**
   - Verify all steps of connection process work smoothly
   - Test edge cases with invalid IPs, unreachable servers
   - Ensure connection status is accurately reflected

3. **App Store Review Simulation**
   - Test as if you're an App Store reviewer with no context
   - Ensure app is understandable without prior Ollama knowledge
   - Verify it's clear this is a client app requiring server setup
